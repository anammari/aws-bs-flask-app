Example phrases include: "we conducted direct observations of the person with disability", "we implemented a functional assessment that involved direct observation by both myself and the support worker". Also look for phrases that mention completion of behavioural data collection tools like ABC note cards and scatter plots, completed by the practitioner or relevant stakeholder. Example phrases include: "I conducted direct observation using ABC note cards to capture antecedents, behaviors, and consequences in the individual's natural environment.", "I completed scatter plots to visually represent the frequency, duration, and intensity of the targeted behaviors over time.".

- "Indirect data collection": To detect any phrases from the paragraph that might represent indirect data collection approaches, look for phrases that mention the use of standardised tools completed by the practitioner in consultation with relevant stakeholders who know the person of focus well, such as Contextual Assessment Inventory, Functional Assessment Interview. Example phrases include: "I conducted a Contextual Assessment Inventory with input from relevant stakeholders", "I utilized the Functional Assessment Interview to gather information from individuals who know the person best". Also look for phrases that mention interviews, phone calls or any other form of communication with relevant stakeholders who know the person of focus well. Example phrases include: "We conducted several phone interviews with family members who have known the person for several years", "We spoke with the person's support workers to gain insight into their daily routines and any challenges they may be experiencing". Also look for phrases that mention consultation of relevant reports (e.g., previous positive behaviour support plans, incident report, previous assessment reports from health and allied health professionals). Example phrases include: "We have consulted relevant reports, such as previous positive behavior support plans, incident reports", "Our team has reviewed previous assessment reports from health and allied health professionals to gather information about any underlying medical or psychological conditions that may be influencing the individual's behavior."
