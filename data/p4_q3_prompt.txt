Guidelines:
The strategies that address the identified setting events are focused on reactively responding to specific negative interactions that may occur between the person with disability and co-tenants or staff members, and providing additional information and reminders to the person with disability after the situation has been de-escalated and he is open to communication. The purpose of these strategies is to help prevent future negative interactions and provide the person with disability with the necessary support to manage his behavior in challenging situations. The strategies that address the triggers/antecedents are focused on proactively addressing the underlying causes of the person with disability's behavior, such as changes in his daily schedule or sleep disturbances. These strategies aim to create a stable and predictable environment for the person with disability, where he can feel comfortable and secure, and provide him with clear communication and choices throughout his day to help him manage his behavior more effectively. There are other strategies such as specific support strategies as well as strategies to improve independence, coping or tolerance.
