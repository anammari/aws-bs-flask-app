Restrictive interventions refer to strategies or actions used to restrict a person's freedom of movement or autonomy in order to prevent them from harming themselves or others. These interventions are typically used as a last resort when all other de-escalation strategies have been exhausted and when there is an immediate risk of harm to the person or others. Examples of restrictive interventions may include physical restraint, seclusion, or the use of medication to manage behavior.

Example Paragraph:
I am a disability practitioner who is managing Eddie, a person with autism. Eddie becomes upset because there is too much noise in the room, so I try to help Eddie calm down by removing him from the situation and giving him some quiet time in a different room. I also talk with Eddie about how he is feeling and what he needs to feel better. If these strategies do not work, I may consider using restrictive interventions such as gently holding Eddie's hand to prevent him from hurting himself or others. I may also use a weighted blanket or vest to calm Eddie down or provide a safe space for Eddie to limit his access to the environment and restrict his freedom of movement in order to prevent harm to himself or others. However, I will only use these strategies as a last resort and will do so in a way that is safe and respectful to Eddie.
