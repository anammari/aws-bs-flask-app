The paragraph below is written in a positive behaviour support plan by a disability practitioner to present a formulation regarding the target behaviours of the person with disability. This formulation summarises the functional behavioural assessment and provides a summary of the contextual factors impacting the target behaviours of the person with disability.

Paragraph:
{query}

Requirement:
- Identify the phrases from the paragraph above that represent each of the following contextual factors: "Background factors", "Contributing factors", "Sustaining factors", "Strength factors". 

Guidelines:
- "Background factors": The background (predisposing) factors refer to the factors that make the person with disability more likely to exhibit the target behaviours. Examples of background factors include: diagnosed disabilities, a diagnosed health conditions, previous history of trauma, previous history of mental health issues, aspects of family and relationships, inappropriate service delivery, and alike. 

- "Contributing factors": The contributing (precipitating) factors refer to the factors that contribute to why is the person with disability is exhibiting the target behaviours now. Example of a contributing factor: a child with autism who engages in self-injurious behavior may be triggered by a noisy and crowded environment, such as a busy shopping mall, which can lead to the behavior occurring. Another example is a person with sensory processing disorder who engages in repetitive behaviors may do so in response to sensory overload, such as bright lights, loud noises, or certain textures.

- "Sustaining factors": The sustaining (perpetuating) factors refer to the factors that support the continuation of the target behaviours exhibited by the person with disability. Example of a sustaining factor: a child who throws tantrums to gain attention from caregivers may be inadvertently reinforced by the attention they receive, leading to the behavior persisting. Another example is a student who engages in disruptive behavior in the classroom may do so to avoid a task they find challenging or aversive, and this avoidance may reinforce the behavior, making it more likely to continue.

- "Strength factors": The strength (protective) factors refer to the factors within the person with disabilityâ€™s context that set them up to succeed. Examples of strength factors include: skills which the person with disability possesses, having skilled and stable support team, having family supports, having friendships, education, employment, and alike.
