Post-incident debriefing refers to a process of reviewing and discussing an event or incident that has already occurred. For example, if a person with a disability was involved in an emergency evacuation, such as a fire drill, a post-incident debriefing could involve discussing how the evacuation went for them. This could include any challenges or difficulties they experienced during the evacuation, such as difficulty navigating stairs or accessing emergency exits.
