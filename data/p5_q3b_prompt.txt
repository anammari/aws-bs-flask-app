Paragraph:
{query}

- Identify the phrases from the paragraph above that represent each of the following plan review topics: "Data Reviewer", "Reported To", "Review Meeting", "Review Timeframe". 

Guidelines:
- "Data Reviewer": refers to the phrases that indicate the person or people who will review the data collected. For example, if the paragraph includes the following text: "Data will be reviewed and analysed by the teacher and myself, including graphing the scatterplot data, and provide a review report to the stakeholder during the stakeholder meetings. The First review meeting will happen in March 2021; the six-month review meeting will happen in May 2021, and the end-of-year review meeting will happen in November 2021". In this example, there is only one "Data Reviewer" phrase, which is "teacher and myself". 

- "Reported To": refers to the phrases that indicate whom the data reviewers will report the collated data to. For example, if the paragraph includes the following text: "Data will be reviewed and analysed by the teacher and myself, including graphing the scatterplot data, and provide a review report to the stakeholder during the stakeholder meetings. The First review meeting will happen in March 2021; the six-month review meeting will happen in May 2021, and the end-of-year review meeting will happen in November 2021". In this example, there is only one "Reported To" phrase, which is "the stakeholder".

- "Review Meeting": refers to the phrases that indicate any review meetings planned. For example, if the paragraph includes the following text: "Data will be reviewed and analysed by the teacher and myself, including graphing the scatterplot data, and provide a review report to the stakeholder during the stakeholder meetings. The First review meeting will happen in March 2021; the six-month review meeting will happen in May 2021, and the end-of-year review meeting will happen in November 2021". In this example, there are four "Review Meeting" phrases, which are "the stakeholder meetings", "First review meeting", "six-month review meeting", "end-of-year review meeting".

- "Review Timeframe": refers to the phrases that indicate any date or timeframe for when the plan will be reviewed. For example, if the paragraph includes the following text: "Data will be reviewed and analysed by the teacher and myself, including graphing the scatterplot data, and provide a review report to the stakeholder during the stakeholder meetings. The First review meeting will happen in March 2021; the six-month review meeting will happen in May 2021, and the end-of-year review meeting will happen in November 2021". In this example, there are three "Review Timeframe" phrases, which are "March 2021", "May 2021", "November 2021".
