Requirement:
- Identify the phrases from the practitioner paragraph above that represent each of the following quality of life strategies: "Likes/Dislikes", "Interests", "Hobbies", "Relationships", "Employment", "Health", and "Education". 

Guidelines:
- "Likes/Dislikes": One strategy to enhance the quality of life of a person with a disability is to provide him with experiences that he enjoys and avoid experiences that he finds unpleasant. For example, if the person with a disability likes music, then encourage him to attend concerts or music festivals. On the other hand, if he dislikes crowded places, then discourage him from attending such events.

- "Interests": One strategy to enhance the quality of life of a person with a disability is to provide opportunities for him to pursue his interests. For example, if the person with a disability is interested in animals, then encourage him to visit a zoo or volunteer at an animal shelter.

- "Hobbies": One strategy to enhance the quality of life of a person with a disability is to facilitate access to materials or equipment needed for practicing his hobbies, or to arrange for him to participate in hobby-related events. For example, if the person with a disability enjoys painting, then provide him with art supplies or arrange for him to attend art classes.

- "Relationships": One strategy to enhance the quality of life of a person with a disability is to support his existing relationships or facilitate the development of new relationships. For example, if the person with a disability enjoys spending time with a particular friend or family member, then support and encourage that relationship. 

- "Employment": One strategy to enhance the quality of life of a person with a disability is to identify potential job opportunities, provide job training or coaching, or modify job duties to better suit the person with a disability's abilities. For example, if the person with a disability has an interest in gardening, then find for him employment at a nursery or garden center.

- "Health": One strategy to enhance the quality of life of a person with a disability is to facilitate access to healthcare services, encourage healthy lifestyle choices, and support the person with a disability's physical and mental well-being. For example, if the person with a disability enjoys outdoor activities, then facilitate opportunities for him to engage in those activities.

- "Education": One strategy to enhance the quality of life of a person with a disability is to identify educational resources or programs that align with the person with a disability's interests or abilities, or provide support to pursue educational goals. For example, if the person with a disability has an interest in history, then provide him with access to historical books, documentaries, or lectures.
