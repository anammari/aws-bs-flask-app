As part of Eddie's behaviour support plan, we use physical restraints when necessary. For example, when Eddie engages in self-harm, I hug him from behind to prevent him from causing harm to himself. If Eddie damages property, we may need to hold his arms down to prevent further damage. Additionally, when administering a COVID test, we may need to hold his arms down and apply pressure to his thighs to prevent him from moving. However, we never use physical restraints as a form of punishment.
In terms of punitive approaches, we sometimes have to using them. For instance, we apply chilli powder to Eddie's nails to stop him from biting his nails. However, we still use positive reinforcement techniques to help him stop this behaviour. We also twist Eddie's skin to inflict pain or threaten to throw away his family photos if he continues to scream. Similarly, we make Eddie clean the apartment after returning home intoxicated.
Our goal is to provide positive supports that improve Eddie's quality of life. We acknowledge that Eddie speaks Anindilyakwa fluently and require an interpreter, so we facilitate access to an interpreter whenever needed. We also respect Eddie's request for an advocate service and work with him to access the service. Overall, our approach is to focus on positive strategies and avoid using physical restraints and punitive approaches.
