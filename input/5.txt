As a positive behaviour support practitioner, I implemented a variety of behavioural assessment approaches in order to develop the positive behaviour support plan for the individual in question.

One approach I used was the completion of paper-based measures and ABC charts by both parents and support staff. These measures allowed me to gather information about the frequency, duration, and intensity of specific behaviours, as well as the antecedents and consequences of those behaviours.

I also conducted structured interviews with relevant stakeholders, including the individual's parents, support staff, and any other individuals who had regular interactions with the individual. These interviews provided valuable insight into the individual's behaviour patterns, as well as any potential triggers or reinforcing factors that may be contributing to the behaviours of concern.

In addition to these approaches, I conducted direct observations of the individual in various environments, including their home, employment setting, and in the community. This allowed me to gather information about the individual's behaviour in different contexts and to identify potential patterns or trends.

I had a discussion with the person's mentors as part of our behavioural assessment process. Eddie's dad provided valuable insights into Eddie's behaviour history and shared with me some recent changes in Eddie's life that may be contributing to his behaviours of concern.

Finally, I also reviewed case files and incident reports, as well as previous assessment reports, in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the individual's behaviour history and any previous interventions that may have been implemented.

Overall, the combination of these behavioural assessment approaches allowed me to gather a wealth of information about the individual's behaviour and to develop a comprehensive and effective positive behaviour support plan that addresses the specific needs and challenges of the individual.
