If Eddie escalates and begins to engage in property damage such as throwing objects and ripping worksheets, move away from Eddie. Do not use threatening postures, a loud voice, and do not tell Eddie to calm down. If Eddie continues in damaging the property, maintain the appearance of being calm. If you can, distract Eddie by asking whether he would like to go outside and play basketball. If Eddie is hitting or attempting to hit people, follow the schoolâ€™s policy and procedures for dealing with behaviours that are a risk of harm to others.
