Eddie, a person with a disability, may employ different strategies to avoid various situations and stimuli that he finds challenging. When faced with activities or tasks assigned to him, Eddie may exhibit procrastination, resistance, or reluctance in starting or completing them. For instance, he might engage in prolonged distractions or find excuses to delay the task at hand. Similarly, Eddie may avoid certain situations to minimize discomfort or overwhelming experiences. Just like Sarah, who avoids going to amusement parks due to difficulties with mobility and long queues, Eddie may also steer clear of environments that pose physical challenges. Moreover, Eddie may follow in Sarah's footsteps and avoid going to busy shopping malls during peak hours to dodge overwhelming crowds and excessive sensory stimulation. Furthermore, Eddie may choose to bypass crowded airports or train stations, just like Sarah, to minimize stress and sensory overload. In addition to these examples, Eddie may actively avoid painful or uncomfortable stimuli by altering his position, covering his ears or eyes, or expressing discomfort through vocalizations or nonverbal cues. He also may avoid attending crowded music rehearsals or performances to prevent sensory overload and discomfort. He might also exhibit sensitivities beyond his five senses, such as aversion to certain textures, tastes, or smells, leading him to avoid specific sensory experiences. Lastly, when overloaded with information, Eddie may exhibit signs of overwhelm or frustration, such as shutting down, becoming non-responsive, or seeking a quieter and less stimulating environment. However, it's important to note that not all situations involve avoidance, as Eddie can also actively engage in tasks, willingly participate in activities, and adapt to various environments based on his needs and preferences.
