If Eddie begins to demonstrate the precursor behaviours to him hitting or engaging in property damage (getting out of his chair, pacing, refusing to make eye contact) go over to him, get his attention and ask him if he would like some help. If Eddie nods his head sit down at the table with him and provide him with the assistance he needs. Do not delay in providing the assistance.  When he has sat down and when it is appropriate to do so, remind Eddie of the ways that he can ask for help from the teacher of the Aide.  When he completes the work support him to engage in a preferred activity before moving on to the next activity.
