As the NDIS practitioner responsible for managing Eddie's disability, I understand the importance of involving him in decisions about his care plan. However, there were certain circumstances that made it challenging for me to consult with Eddie regarding the acceptability of the proposed strategies and data gathering activities. For instance, Eddie's communication abilities are significantly impacted by his autism, which makes it difficult to gauge his understanding and perspectives on complex issues including directly consulting with him on his support plan. Additionally, I recognized that Eddie may experience anxiety or discomfort when discussing unfamiliar concepts related to his care, which could have potentially negative consequences for his mental health. Therefore, I decided to prioritize his emotional wellbeing by refraining from direct consultation and instead relying on input from his family, previous consultations, and other healthcare professionals to develop his support plan. Besides, there may have been underlying social, cultural, or personal factors that made it difficult for Eddie to express his preferences or perspectives on his care plan. These could include past experiences of discrimination or marginalization, discomfort with authority figures, or lack of familiarity with certain healthcare terminology.
