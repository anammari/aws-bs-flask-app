Eddie is a person with a disability who we have been working with to develop a behavior support plan. We began by conducting a thorough speech and language assessment to evaluate his communication abilities. This assessment included measures of his articulation, language comprehension, and expressive language skills. Following this, we conducted a psychiatric assessment to evaluate his emotional and mental well-being. This assessment included a clinical interview, observation of his behavior, and a review of his medical history. Finally, we also conducted a medical assessment to evaluate his overall physical health. This assessment included a physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

Eddie has been making progress in his therapy sessions and is able to communicate effectively with his caretakers. He enjoys spending time outdoors and is particularly fond of going for walks. Eddie also has a keen interest in music and likes to listen to his favorite songs. He likes to interact with people and is very social.
