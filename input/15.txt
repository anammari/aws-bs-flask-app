The goal of the positive behavior support plan for Eddie is to reduce the frequency and severity of challenging behaviors and increase his skills and independence. One goal is reducing aggressive behavior by 50% over the next three months, as measured by daily observations and incidents recorded in a log. Another goal is increasing communication skills by learning to use 10 new words related to his daily routine over the next six months, as measured by a weekly progress report from his speech therapist. Another goal is improving independent living skills by completing two daily tasks, such as brushing teeth or putting on shoes, without support from staff within the next eight months, as measured by daily checklists completed by staff. A final goal is increasing social interaction by participating in group activities with peers for at least 30 minutes per day, three days a week, over the next 12 months, as observed and documented by staff during group sessions.
