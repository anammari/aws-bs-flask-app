When developing a positive behavior support plan for Eddie, I will use a combination of reinforcement strategies to encourage him to complete work and demonstrate desired behaviors while learning new skills. First, I will offer Eddie privileges by allowing him to participate in his preferred activities such as painting or playing games on the computer after completing his work. I will also provide breaks between lessons as a reward for completing work, such as a 10-minute break to play with his favorite toy. In addition, I will give Eddie verbal praise as a reward for demonstrating desired behaviors, such as saying "Great job, Eddie!" or "You worked really hard today." I will also offer social interaction as a reward by allowing him to spend time with his peers or family members, such as having lunch with his best friend or calling his grandmother on the phone. I will also provide physical rewards as a token of my appreciation for Eddie's efforts, such as stickers or small toys. Finally, I will give him attention by engaging in positive interactions with him, such as sitting with him while he completes his work and offering help and guidance when he needs it.	By using a range of reinforcement strategies that reflect Eddie's preferences and interests, I hope to motivate him to complete his work and demonstrate positive behaviors during the learning process. The goal is to create a positive and supportive learning environment that encourages Eddie's success and builds his confidence.
