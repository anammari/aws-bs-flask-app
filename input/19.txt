In preparing the behavior support plan for Taylor, a person with disability, several strategies have been identified to address the identified setting events and triggers/antecedents. To address specific negative interactions, staff will ensure Taylor receives extra information and reminders about his daily activities, and will have alternative options available in case of any changes. Additionally, staff will engage in frequent communication with Taylor to ensure he has clear expectations and choices throughout the day. To proactively address triggers and antecedents, staff will maintain a consistent daily schedule for Taylor and investigate possible causes of sleep disturbances. Furthermore, specific support strategies, such as the use of speech and sign language and clear, concise communication, will be implemented to improve Taylor's independence and coping skills. To enhance his tolerance, staff will gradually introduce new experiences and support him through any challenges he may face. Phrases that do not describe any strategy, such as "best practices" and "evidence-based approaches," will be avoided in favor of concrete, actionable strategies tailored to Taylor's unique needs.
