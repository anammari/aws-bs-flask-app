After conducting a thorough functional behavioral assessment of Eddie, it appears that his target behaviors stem from a variety of contextual factors. Eddie is a 25-year-old man with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, who exhibits a range of challenging behaviors including self-injury, aggression, and property destruction. The formulation of Eddie's behaviors includes the following contextual factors:

Background factors: Eddie's background factors suggest that he has experienced significant adversity and trauma throughout his life. Eddie was adopted at the age of four after experiencing neglect and abuse in his early years. He has a history of being hospitalized for self-injury and aggression, and he struggles with anxiety and sensory processing issues. These background factors may have predisposed Eddie to exhibit the target behaviors he displays.

Contributing factors: The contributing factors to Eddie's behaviors are multi-faceted. Eddie struggles with communication and has limited expressive language skills, which makes it difficult for him to express his needs and desires effectively. Additionally, Eddie experiences significant sensory sensitivities that can trigger his challenging behaviors, such as when he is exposed to loud noises or crowded environments. Furthermore, Eddie's history of being restrained and secluded in hospital settings has led to trauma and anxiety surrounding certain stimuli, which can contribute to his behaviors.

Sustaining factors: The sustaining factors that maintain Eddie's challenging behaviors include a lack of appropriate coping strategies and supports. Eddie has limited access to positive reinforcement, socialization opportunities, and leisure activities, which can lead to boredom and frustration. In addition, Eddie's challenging behaviors have inadvertently led to increased attention from staff and caregivers, which can reinforce the behaviors.

Strength factors: Despite Eddie's challenges, he has several protective factors that can be built upon to support positive behaviors. Eddie is generally cooperative and compliant, and he responds well to structure and routine. Eddie has a strong desire to engage in meaningful activities, and he has a talent for art and music. Furthermore, Eddie has a supportive family who is invested in his success.

Overall, the contextual factors impacting Eddie's behaviors are complex and multi-layered. However, with a positive behavior support plan that addresses his communication needs, sensory sensitivities, and provides appropriate coping strategies and supports, Eddie can be successful in achieving his goals and reducing his challenging behaviors. The plan should leverage Eddie's strengths and protective factors, while addressing the underlying causes of his behaviors.
