I am a disability practitioner who is managing Taylor, a person with intellectual disability. Taylor becomes upset when there are changes to their routine or schedule, so I try to help Taylor calm down by using de-escalation strategies such as visual schedules or social stories to help Taylor understand what will happen next. I also talk with Taylor about how they are feeling and what they need to feel better. If these strategies do not work, I may consider using restrictive interventions such as redirecting Taylor's attention to a different activity or using a calming sensory toy. I may also be providing a safe space for Taylor to retreat to when feeling overwhelmed, which involves limiting their access to the environment and restricting their freedom of movement in order to prevent harm to themselves or others. However, I will only use these strategies as a last resort and will do so in a way that is safe and respectful to Taylor.
