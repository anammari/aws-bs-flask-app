As a disability practitioner who supports Eddie, a 25-year old man with a disability, there are several strategies that can be implemented to enhance his quality of life. One important strategy is to identify and support his likes and dislikes. Eddie has expressed an interest in music and sports, so providing opportunities for him to attend music events or sporting events would be beneficial. Additionally, Eddie has a strong interest in animals, so arranging for him to volunteer at an animal shelter or attend a petting zoo would be enriching experiences for him. Another strategy is to identify and support Eddie's relationships. Eddie's biggest hobby is football and therefore I always encourage him to watch live football games. Eddie has a close relationship with his sister, so encouraging and facilitating visits with her would be important. Eddie is also interested in making new friends, so arranging for him to attend social events or join a club related to his interests could help him expand his social circle. In addition, supporting Eddie's health is important for his overall well-being. Eddie enjoys spending time outdoors, so facilitating outdoor activities such as walks or hikes would be beneficial for his physical and mental health. These strategies aim to enhance Eddie's quality of life and promote his overall well-being. Another important strategy to enhance Eddie's quality of life is to support him in employment. Eddie has expressed an interest in working at a local grocery store, so I will work with him to develop his job skills, such as customer service, and support him in applying for jobs. Once he is employed, I will provide job coaching to help him succeed in his role. This will provide him with a sense of purpose and fulfillment, as well as financial security. Lastly, supporting Eddie in education is another key strategy to enhance his quality of life. Eddie has expressed a desire to learn more about music, so I will work with him to identify educational resources, such as online courses or local music schools. Additionally, Eddie has shown an interest in history, so I will provide him with historical books, documentaries, or lectures to encourage his continued learning. These strategies will help Eddie pursue his educational interests and achieve his personal goals.
