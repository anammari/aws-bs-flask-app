As a disability practitioner who supports Taylor, a 15-year-old boy with a disability, there are several strategies that can be implemented to enhance his quality of life. One important strategy is to identify and support his interests. Taylor enjoys playing video games, so incorporating video game time into his daily schedule would be beneficial for him. Additionally, Taylor is a fan of superhero movies, so setting up movie nights with his family or friends once a month would be a fun way for him to enjoy his interest. Another strategy is to support Taylor's relationships. Taylor has expressed an interest in making new friends, so facilitating social events or encouraging him to join a club related to his interests could help him expand his social circle. Additionally, Taylor has a close relationship with his older sister, so setting up a weekly video chat or arranging for them to participate in an activity together every other week would be important. In addition, supporting Taylor's health is important for his overall well-being. Taylor enjoys swimming, so facilitating regular swimming sessions at the local pool twice a week would be beneficial for his physical and mental health. These strategies aim to enhance Taylor's quality of life and promote his overall well-being. Another important strategy is to support Taylor's education. Taylor has expressed a desire to improve his math skills, so I will work with him to identify educational resources and set up weekly tutoring sessions. Additionally, Taylor has shown an interest in learning to cook, so setting up bi-weekly cooking classes would provide him with an opportunity to learn a new skill and gain confidence in the kitchen. These strategies will help Taylor pursue his educational interests and achieve his personal goals.
