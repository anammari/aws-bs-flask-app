Eddie, a person with a disability, may engage in various behaviors to seek activities or tasks to be assigned to him. He might actively approach his teacher or peers, expressing interest in participating in specific projects or group activities. For instance, Eddie may request to be included in a science experiment or express enthusiasm about joining a debate club. Additionally, he may seek to own items that he prefers by indicating his personal preferences to his teacher or caretaker. This could involve expressing a desire for specific books, art supplies, or adaptive tools that would enhance his learning or daily activities. Furthermore, Eddie may seek to do or access other functions or concepts beyond activities, tasks, or items. For instance, he may seek opportunities to engage in mentoring programs, where he can share his experiences and insights with others. Alternatively, he may express a strong desire to participate in disability advocacy initiatives or attend conferences focused on inclusive education. It is important to note that not all of Eddie's actions are related to seeking. He may also engage in neutral behaviors such as quietly listening to instructions or observing his surroundings without actively seeking any specific tasks, items, or concepts.
