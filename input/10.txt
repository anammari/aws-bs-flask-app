Taylor will make a deep humming/grunting noise and pace when he is unsure of what is happening next. This behavior is not only used as a means to access staff support [the provision of information] and avoid or escape unpleasant stimuli such as noise or to obtain a tangible item, but also to gain his teacher attention. He uses his body and strength to get to things that he wants, such as food items. This behavior may become aggressive towards others and property as a means of escaping or avoiding a noisy, busy environment or other residents who are being disruptive. Additionally, it may also be used as a means to finish work in class or avoid hard work.
It is possible that pleading for fluid may also be a way to initiate interactions with others. It is hypothesized that Taylor may engage in self-harm as a means of stimulation. It is reported that Taylor has sensory processing difficulties and may be primarily seeking touch, movement, conduct and visual stimulation. The self-harm may intrinsically be rewarding to him as it provides him with the necessary sensory stimulation. Additionally, this behaviour may also be used as a means to escape unwanted tasks, demands or situations to get tangible items, such as preferred objects or activities.
