In observing Eddie, I have identified several early warning signs that indicate he may display challenging behaviours. Physical signs include Eddie clenching his fists and tensing his shoulders. Verbal signs include him speaking in an agitated tone, using swear words, and making threatening statements. Environmental signs include Eddie becoming upset in crowded or noisy spaces, and when his routine is disrupted. Emotional signs include Eddie becoming withdrawn and disengaged, as well as showing signs of frustration and anxiety. Behavioural signs include Eddie refusing to follow instructions or requests, making demands, and engaging in repetitive or obsessive behaviours such as pacing back and forth. These early warning signs provide important cues to Eddie's emotional state and help us to identify and respond to his needs before they escalate into challenging behaviour.
