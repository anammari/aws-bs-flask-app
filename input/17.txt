As an observer, I notice signs that indicate potential challenging behaviors in Eddie. These signs primarily involve actions and verbal expressions. Eddie's physical signs are evident in his clenched fists and tensed shoulders. Verbal signs become apparent when he speaks in an agitated tone, uses explicit language, or makes threatening statements. These physical and verbal indicators provide important insights into Eddie's emotional state and help us anticipate and respond to his needs before they escalate into challenging behaviors.
