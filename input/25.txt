As an outcome measurement strategy, I will use a rating scale to assign a score to each goal that represents Eddie's current level of functioning and the desired level of functioning. This requires collaborative data collection efforts between the practitioner, the person with disability, and their support network. The data collected for outcome measurements includes baseline data, Goal Attainment Scaling scores, progress notes, and follow-up data. Baseline data is collected before the implementation of the behavior support plan, while Goal Attainment Scaling scores are used to measure progress towards the identified goals. Progress notes document any events or incidents during implementation, while follow-up data is collected to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the intervention. Afterwards, I will use the data collected to adjust the behavior support plan as needed to ensure that Eddie is making progress towards the desired outcomes.
