Eddie, a person with a disability, exhibits various behaviors in relation to seeking or avoiding social interactions. When seeking social interactions, Eddie might initiate conversations with his peers or teacher, actively engaging in group activities and demonstrating a willingness to participate. He may use assistive technology, such as a communication device, to interact and connect with others. For instance, if Eddie has a shared interest, he might initiate discussions or seek out like-minded individuals to share his enthusiasm. Furthermore, he may display a friendly and approachable demeanor, actively seeking opportunities to bond and connect with others.
On the other hand, when attempting to avoid social interactions, Eddie may exhibit behaviors that distance him from others. For instance, if Eddie experiences social anxiety, he might avoid eye contact or actively withdraw from group activities to reduce feelings of discomfort. Additionally, if Eddie finds it challenging to understand social cues, he may struggle with participating in group conversations or activities, leading to a sense of isolation. In such situations, he may prefer solitary activities or engage in self-directed tasks that minimize the need for social interaction. However, it's important to note that Eddie's avoidance of social interactions doesn't necessarily imply disinterest or unfriendliness. It may simply reflect his unique needs and preferences in managing social situations.
In certain instances, Eddie may exhibit neutral behaviors that neither seek nor avoid social interactions. These can include moments when he calmly observes his surroundings without actively engaging with others, or when he focuses on personal tasks or interests that do not require social interaction. These neutral behaviors offer Eddie the opportunity for self-reflection, independent learning, or relaxation, without explicitly aiming to seek or avoid social interactions.
