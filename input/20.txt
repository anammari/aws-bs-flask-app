The strategy for teaching Eddie how to ask for help or a break in the classroom involves using explicit instruction, role play, and a social story with pictures as teaching materials. Each morning before Eddie begins his schoolwork, the classroom teacher's aide will provide him with dedicated instruction on how to ask for help or a break. The teacher's aide will use role play to help Eddie practice the steps involved in asking for help or a break, while the social story will serve as a visual aid to remind Eddie of the skill he has learned. The teacher's aide will also use a reward system to encourage and reinforce Eddie's use of the skill. To support the instruction, the teacher's aide may use cue cards or other visual aids to prompt Eddie to use the skill when needed. The classroom teacher and the allocated teacher's aide will be responsible for implementing the teaching strategy, and will monitor Eddie's progress by recording data. All teaching will occur in the classroom. Teaching will cease when Eddie has mastered all aspects of the skill and is able to use it without prompting for a period of one month.
