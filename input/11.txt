Eddie, a person with a disability, might be doing various things to gain the attention of his teacher. He may be making exaggerated movements or vocalizations, using assistive technology such as a communication device or he may be seeking help from a teacher's aide. For example, if Eddie is hard of hearing, he may be asking the teacher to repeat instructions or to speak louder. If Eddie is visually impaired, he may be asking the teacher to provide written instructions or to describe what's happening on the board. Additionally, he may be raising his hand frequently to ask or answer questions or to seek clarification. On the other hand, to avoid the attention of the teacher, Eddie may also be doing some things. For example, if Eddie has anxiety, he may be avoiding eye contact or withdrawing from group activities. If Eddie is hyperactive, he may be fidgeting in his seat or having difficulty staying in one place. Additionally, if Eddie is on the autism spectrum, he may be having difficulty understanding social cues or participating in group activities. He may also be avoiding social interactions, or having difficulty initiating conversations with his peers or teacher.
