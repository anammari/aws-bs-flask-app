Eddie, a person with a disability, may engage in different behaviors to seek people or access to people, as well as to avoid them. In some instances, Eddie seeks interaction and connection with others. For example, he may actively approach his peers during group activities, initiate conversations with his classmates, or join inclusive clubs to meet new people. Eddie might also seek access to people by attending social events, such as community gatherings or inclusive workshops, where he can engage in meaningful conversations and build relationships. Additionally, Eddie may seek assistance and support from people, such as seeking guidance from his teachers or reaching out to his friends for help with tasks or assignments.
On the other hand, there are times when Eddie may prefer to avoid people or access to people. For instance, if Eddie experiences social anxiety, he might avoid crowded environments or situations that involve large groups of people. In such instances, he may choose to spend time in quieter settings or engage in solitary activities. Eddie might also avoid certain social interactions or conversations that make him uncomfortable or overwhelmed. Moreover, if Eddie is feeling overwhelmed or fatigued, he might seek temporary solitude or engage in activities that allow him to recharge, such as taking breaks in quiet areas or using sensory-regulating strategies.
Furthermore, there are neutral situations where Eddie's actions do not involve seeking or avoiding people or access to people. These instances could include focusing on individual tasks, participating in independent hobbies or interests, or engaging in self-reflection and personal growth. In these cases, Eddie may be prioritizing his own needs and well-being without explicitly seeking or avoiding social interactions or access to people.
