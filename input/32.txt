As the NDIS practitioner responsible for managing Eddie, I have not taught him any new skills or alternative behaviours for a number of reasons. Firstly, Eddie has a very limited capacity to learn due to the severity of his autism. Secondly, his behaviours are not causing any harm to himself or others, and are not significantly interfering with his ability to participate in daily activities. Thirdly, Eddie is comfortable with his current routines and any changes to these routines could cause him distress or anxiety. Fourthly, Eddie has a strong support network of family and carers who are able to manage his current behaviours effectively without the need for additional skills or behaviours to be taught. Finally, as Eddie is non-verbal and has limited communication skills, teaching him new skills or behaviours would require a significant amount of time and resources, which may not necessarily lead to any meaningful improvements in his quality of life. Based on these reasons, it is not necessary to teach Eddie any new skills or behaviours at this time.
