In preparing the positive behavior support plan, our team utilized a combination of direct and indirect data collection approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of the person of focus and their behavior patterns. Direct data collection approaches included conducting direct observations of the individual by both the practitioner and support workers, as well as the completion of behavioral data collection tools such as ABC note cards and scatter plots. Indirect data collection methods included the use of standardized tools completed by the practitioner in consultation with relevant stakeholders who know the individual well, such as the Contextual Assessment Inventory and Functional Assessment Interview. We also conducted interviews and engaged in communication with family members, caregivers, and healthcare professionals to gather additional information about the individual's behavior patterns and needs. Additionally, we consulted relevant reports, such as previous positive behavior support plans, incident reports, and assessment reports from health and allied health professionals to gain insight into potential triggers and reinforcement patterns that may be contributing to the individual's challenging behaviors. By utilizing both direct and indirect data collection approaches, we were able to develop a comprehensive positive behavior support plan that is tailored to the unique needs of the individual.
